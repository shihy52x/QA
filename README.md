The code worked fine two days ago. However, after I installed several other packages for deep learning in my conda yesterday, pandas package was  not working anymore. I believe some depended packages were updated and caused backward compatibility issue. I will update the code later once I solve this issue. Since I change the code a little bit today. It may not be bug-free.

I did not write any classes yet since this is an early stage of development. I was trying to pay more attention to set up a model and get some intial results.
